# MobTimer
Mob programming is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. This is similar to pair programming where two people sit at the same computer and collaborate on the same code at the same time. With Mob Programming the collaboration is extended to everyone on the team, while still using a single computer for writing the code and inputting it into the code base.

It builds on principles of lean manufacturing, extreme programming, and lean software development. Early use of the phrase "Mob programming", was made in "Extreme Programming Perspectives"

## Why a specific timer?
Using a specific timer can be ignored! A mob timer cannot. This application interrupts workflow by taking over the screen and plays an audible foghorn
